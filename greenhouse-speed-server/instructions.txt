Hello! This program is meant to control Greenhouse RABR speed remotely. 

Installation:
  - The Raspberry Pi should be registered with the Bluezone network and given a hostname. Use a name that is easy to remember.
  - This Python program should be set to run on startup on the Raspberry Pi.

Usage:
  - After setup, you will be able to login to the control panel from anywhere by typing http://hostname.bluezone.usu.edu into your browser's address bar - this only works
    while you are on the USU network. This means that you can log in from any campus or lab building, or from anywhere using the USU VPN (at vpn.usu.edu)
